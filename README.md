# hack-a-thing-1-98-degrees
Worked alone on this.

I learned React-Native using the Facebook tutorial. I made an app to toggle between cat pictures. I would have liked to have taken arbitrary cat pictures from cat-picture subreddits, but that proved challenging. Perhaps area for future work?

Hack-a-thing-2: tried (and failed spectacularly) to scrap pictures from the subreddits and display a random selection in the app. I added a random fox and toggling functionality (courtesy of foxrudor.de), though!

Made use of grab_pictures.py at https://github.com/nobodyme/reddit-fetch to scrape images. I modified it to scrape image urls, and then tried (and failed spectacularly!) to display the scraped images in the app.

I wouldn't be opposed to working on a mobile app for a project, though this endeavour (flop) has taught me to be careful about how I access data from within ReactNative (and about when I start projects).

This is really bad. I'm sorry.
